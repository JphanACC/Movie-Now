# User Story
The user will go to the homepage and be shown a listing of movies and theaters that are available. The user will be able to browse theatre and movie pages without logging in. The theatre pages will show all the movies and movie times in that theatre. 
The movie pages will show all of the theatres it is shown in as well as a description of that movie, including director, actors, plot summary and genre. The user can sign-up and create a profile. They will also have the option to edit or delete their profile. When the user is logged-in, they will be able to click links on the theatre page and are taken to another page to purchace tickets. They will be given an option for the number of tickets desired and they will enter their payment information. There will be an admin section. A user logged in as an admin will have access to create, edit and delete movies and theatres. The admin section of the site will be inaccessable to regular users.
# MVP
The MVP version of the site will contain a model for theatres and movies. These models will have full CRUD functionality and will be linked in a many-to-many relationship. A site vistor will be able to view movies and theatres in the database and select the movie that they wish to see. The admin route will be unprotected. The admin will have a limited menu of showtime options. There will not be a user model.
